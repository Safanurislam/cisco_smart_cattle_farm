**Smart Cattle Farm with Cisco IoT, VLAN, and Dynamic Routing**
**Overview**
The Smart Cattle Farm project leverages Cisco's advanced networking technologies to create an intelligent and efficient farming environment. By integrating IoT devices, VLANs, and dynamic routing, this solution enhances the management and monitoring of cattle farming operations.

**Features**
IoT Devices Integration: Cisco IoT devices are deployed throughout the farm to gather real-time data on various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and animal health.

VLAN Configuration: Cisco switches are utilized to segment the network into Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), ensuring secure and efficient communication between different farm systems while maintaining isolation where necessary.

Dynamic Routing: Cisco routers implement dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF or EIGRP to enable automatic route selection and optimization, facilitating seamless communication between different segments of the farm network.

**Installation**
Hardware Setup: Deploy Cisco networking hardware including switches, routers, and IoT devices as per the project requirements.

Configuration: Configure VLANs on Cisco switches to segment the network. Set up dynamic routing protocols on Cisco routers for efficient routing between VLANs.

Integration: Connect IoT devices to the network and configure them to communicate with Cisco networking equipment.

Testing: Test the connectivity and functionality of the system to ensure proper integration and operation.

**Usage**
Monitoring: Use Cisco network monitoring tools to monitor the status of IoT devices, VLANs, and routing protocols in real-time.

**Data Analysis:** Analyze the data collected by IoT devices to gain insights into farm conditions and optimize operations for improved efficiency and productivity.
